# 20 Newsgroups Text Classification

This repository contains code for text classification on the 20 Newsgroups dataset using machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The dataset is preprocessed, and features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization. The models are trained and evaluated on the dataset, and the results are visualized using confusion matrices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **20 Newsgroups** dataset, which is available on Kaggle. You can download the dataset from the following link:
